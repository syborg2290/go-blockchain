## Blockchain network using Go

# With Web 3.0 and blockchain becoming more mainstream every day.Although blockchain has several undeniable use-cases, at the moment, the number one application is payments. This is because banks are still running on an inefficient, 40 year old infrastructure powered by CSV files and FTP.

# Why Go?

- Because like blockchain, it's a fantastic technology for your overall programming career. Go is a trendy language and Go devs are better paid than the average Java/PHP/Javascript positions.

- Go is optimized for multi-core CPU architecture. You can spawn thousands of light-weight threads (Go-routines) without problems. It's extremely practical for highly parallel and concurrent software such as blockchain networks.

- By writing your software in Go, you achieve nearly C++ level of performance out of the box without killing yourself for that one time you forgot to free up memory.

- Go also compiles to binary which makes it very portable.
